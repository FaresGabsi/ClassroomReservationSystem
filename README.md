# # Classroom Reservation System Microservices

This project implements a microservices-based classroom reservation system using Spring Boot. It offers modularity, scalability, and maintainability compared to a monolithic architecture.

Microservices:

Classroom Service:

Manages classrooms.
Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on classrooms.
Exposes endpoints for:
Creating new classrooms.
Retrieving existing classrooms (individually or all).
Updating classroom details.
Deleting classrooms.
Reservation Service:

Handles classroom reservations.
Provides CRUD operations on reservations.
Ensures no overlapping reservations for a classroom.
Exposes endpoints for:
Booking a classroom for a specific time slot.
Viewing existing reservations (individually or all).
Modifying existing reservations (subject to availability).
Canceling reservations.
User Service:

Handles user authentication and authorization.
Allows user registration and login.
Issues tokens upon successful login for secure access to other services.
Implements role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict unauthorized operations (optional, depending on your requirements).
Exposes endpoints for:
User registration.
User login (returns a JWT or similar token).
Recommendation Service:

Recommends suitable classrooms based on user needs.
Consumes data from Classroom Service and Reservation Service.
Analyzes factors like classroom size, equipment availability, and existing reservations.
Suggests optimal classrooms based on user requirements.
(Optional) Offers features to learn user preferences over time and personalize recommendations.
Exposes endpoints for:
Fetching classroom recommendations based on specified criteria.
Technology Stack:

Spring Boot
Spring Cloud (optional, for service discovery and communication)
JPA or similar for data persistence
JWT or similar for authentication (consider security best practices)
Other libraries as needed (e.g., for validation, caching, etc.)
Getting Started

Clone this repository.
Install required dependencies (refer to project-specific instructions).
Configure database connections in application properties files.
(Optional) Configure security settings in application properties files.
Run each microservice using its Spring Boot application class.
